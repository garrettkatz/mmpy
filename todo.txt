bigger scope class
    can construct it from a starting point like current method
    can push/pop from it while scanning database similar to mmverify.py

new inference data structure
    an inference does this:
        match all hyps of existing rule against a list of dependencies
            dependencies can be floating/essential hypotheses or other proved a/p statements
        apply match substitution to conclusion of existing rule
        have a new rule with the substituted conclusion and hypotheses based on dependencies
            all floating/essential dependencies
            all floating/essential leaves used in proving a/p dependencies?
    an inference data structure maintains this:
        pointer to the existing rule used as justification
        pointer to the newly created rule
        the substitution that created it
